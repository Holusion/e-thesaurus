            ECorpus lets you <b>store, annotate and share your 3D models</b>. It uses <a
                href="https://smithsonian.github.io/dpo-voyager/" target="_blank"><b>DPO-Voyager</b></a> as a 3D viewer and
            metadata
            editor, and features a user rights and modification history manager.
        </p>
        <p>
            The development of eCorpus was initiated as part of the <a
                href="https://ethesaurus.holusion.com/fr/about"><b>eThesaurus</b></a> consortium. The project involved the
            digitization of six works of medieval goldsmith's art, held by the Musée Sandelin in Saint-Omer and the Palais des Beaux-arts in
            Lille.

        <p>Digital models derived from <b>photogrammetry</b> include information relating to the object's geometry in the form
            of a mesh, as well as information relating to its visual appearance as described in a PBR (Physical Based Rendering)

        <h4>Complete</h4>
        <p>
            eCorpus allows you <b>to link data directly to each 3D object</b> through enriched annotations annotations: title,
            abstract and article that can include multimedia content (videos, images, links, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
            You can then orchestrate this data, alongside your 3D objects, <b>to create animated scenes (called "Towers")</b>, ideal for
            showcasing your 3D objects in a museum or educational setting. pédagogique. It also facilitates <b>collaborative research</b>
            thanks to analysis and d'export.
        </p>
        <h4>Viewable via browser</h4>
        <p>
            eCorpus software is <b>fully accessible via a simple web browser</b>. So you can easily connect to any machine and show or even
            share your catalog of 3D objects by creating a new account for a third party.
        </p>
        <h4>Open but secure</h4>
        <p>
            The application architecture works by deploying independent instances, <b>with the databases compatible with each other,
            but entirely separate</b>.
            The majority of use cases concern entities that already have a content management solution, such as Omeka S. eCorpus
            data can be integrated and searched within these solutions.
        </p>
        <h4>Open source</h4>
        <p>
            The results of development are distributed in Open Source format, so that users have full ownership of their data and
            environment. What's more, the dynamism of an Open Source project is crucial to its success and distribution. The
            presence of its documentation on a platform like <a
                href="https://github.com/Holusion/eThesaurus" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and regular
            development activity with a clearly identiﬁed team.
        </p>
        <h4>Structure</h4>
        <p>
            Each entry in the database has a data structure organized in <a
                href="https://smithsonian.github.io/dpo-voyager/document/overview/" target="_blank"><b>a reference JSON
                    ﬁchier</b></a>, with related ﬁchiers (3D objects, textures, articles, images, videos, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
            This organization provides <b>a high degree of ﬂexibility</b>: exported data can be used as they are independently of
            the server on which they are stored.
        </p>
        <p>
            The scene description ﬁchier enables <b>the management of models with multiple levels of detail (LOD)</b>, as well as
            the translation of different metadata. as well as the translation of various metadata.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each entry in the database can therefore be made up of an assembly of sub-elements, and each of these can include
            multi-resolution models, <b>offering optimized geometry loading by the customer</b>, limiting the loading of complex data
            according to his needs.

        They can be derived from non-photographic recordings, <b>such as non-visible light or fluoroscopy</b>, and therefore
        offer different visualizations of the model.

    <p>
        <b>These 3D models can also be used to store data relating to their animation.</b>
        This step of storing movement information is important for mechanism simulations such as clocks, or complex assembly/disassembly demonstrations.

            eCorpus lets you distribute 3D objects and metadata in two different conﬁgurations.

        <ul class="retrait">
            <li>
                On the one hand, <b>by integrating the Voyager viewer into a web page or application</b>, you can directly request the latest
                version of the 3D object from the server, according to its distribution rights. This is the easiest way <b>to present
                    results on institutional sites, by email or via mobile applications</b>. The latest developments in <b>Augmented Reality</b> mean
                that objects can be displayed directly in this format using the AR Kit on Apple 8 or Android, without the need to
                install a third-party application.
            </li>
            <li>
                On the other hand, <b>when an Internet connection is not possible</b> (off-site installations, for example), eCorpus lets you
                <b>create applications running on a local database</b>, exported in advance from the online platform. This allows you to work
                asynchronously and add data without an Internet connection. Data must then be resynchronized by export.

        Among the various export formats for mediation, eCorpus supports visualization on touch-screen tables, mobile tablets,
        holograms and virtual and augmented reality devices.
        The <a href="./about">eThesaurus</a> demonstrator, manufactured by Holusion, visualizes an export of an eCorpus database. The display is split
        over two screens:

            <b>Navigation is provided by a secondary screen in front of the device.</b> Touch control was chosen for its prevalence with
            audiences accustomed to handling smartphones and tablets on a daily basis. On this screen, users can also consult
            textual information and complementary photo and video media included in the articles.
