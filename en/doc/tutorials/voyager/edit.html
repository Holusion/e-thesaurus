<h2 id="Creating-a-scene-step-by-step">Creating a scene step by step</h2>
<p>
  Learn how to create a 3D scene using the <a href="https://smithsonian.github.io/dpo-voyager/story/overview/"
    target="_blank">Voyager Story</a> editor. This tutorial assumes that you have a 3D model in .glb
  format ready to send. Options and recommendations for creating a 3D file for eCorpus are available on <a
    href="/en/doc/references/models/">this page</a>.
</p>

<div>
  <!--slide 0 - Importer-->
  <div>
    <h3 id="Import-a-model">Import a model</h3>
    <p>
      Import a .glb model by dragging it into the model list from your files or by clicking the "Upload a scene" button.
    </p>
    <img src="/assets/img/doc/eCorpus-import.jpg" alt="screen of eCorpus, 3D scene manager">
    <p>
      Then click on "story ➝" to access the Voyager scene editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to test the editor without creating a new scene in eCorpus, you can use the editor "standalone" mode.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case, import your model directly into the editor.
    </p>

    <h3 id="Rename-the-scene">Rename the scene</h3>
    <p>
      To rename your scene, go to the "Collection" tab and change the title.
    </p>

    <p>
      In standalone mode, the default name is "Missing Title".
    </p>
  </div>
  <!--slide 2 - Positionner-->
  <div>
    <h3 id="Position-and-resize">Position and resize the model</h3>
    <p>
      Go to the {% include button.html name="pose" icon="move" %} tab and select your model to adjust its position.
    </p>
    <img src="/assets/img/doc/Voyager-edit-pose.jpg" alt="screen of Voyager application, position the model">
    <p>
      You can then recenter it in the scene and adjust its position and rotation using the<span>Top</span>,
      <span>Left</span> and <span>Front</span> view windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be sure to check the unit of measurement for the scene and object. You can use the {% include button.html
      name="measure" icon="tape" %} tool in the {% include button.html icon="tools" class="voyager-btn-rounded" %}
      settings to check the size of the model:

  </div>
  <!--slide 3 - Capturer-->
  <div>
    <h3 id="Take-screenshots">Take screenshots and save the state of the scene</h3>
    <p>
      Once the model is positioned as desired, go to the {% include button.html name="capture" icon="camera" %} tab to
      save its position and generate a thumbnail image.
    </p>
    <img src="/assets/img/doc/Voyager-edit-capture.jpg" alt="screen of Voyager application, capture the scene">
